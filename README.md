# wrong-way-racer

Just install dependencies and do `npm run dev`.
Please notice that I'm using latest node version described on .nvmrc file.  

Some features are missing from figma, for example, game speed and chat send interface.
They are easy to implement, I just didn't had much time to do it, so I just focused on the game and to interface details, as I think they are more valuable to be show.

Send em an email if you have any further questions:
