# wrong-way-racer

Just install dependencies and do `npm run dev`
Some features are missing from figma, for example, game speed and chat send interface.
They are easy to implement, I just don't didn't had much time to do it, so I just focused on the game and to interface details, as I think they are more valuable to be show.

Send em an email if you have any further questions:
